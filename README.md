# ECBM_4060 Final Project

### Overview
This project performs membrane segmentation with FCN regularized by topological loss with critical structure extracted from Discrete Morse Theory (DMT). It aims to reproduce the work of Hu et al. (2021) and applies the method on plant & MIBI-ToF images. 

### Running
